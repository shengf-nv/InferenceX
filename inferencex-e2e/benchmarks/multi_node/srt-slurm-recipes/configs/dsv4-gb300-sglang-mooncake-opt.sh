# The recipes put ${SGLANG_SRC}/python on PYTHONPATH so the servers import the
# reviewed branch instead of the container's installed SGLang, while still
# using the container's compiled kernels. If the runner failed to clone the
# tree, PYTHONPATH silently resolves to the stock package and the job would
# benchmark the wrong code, so fail loudly here instead.
#
# Delete this script, its runner wiring, and the recipes' setup_script and
# environment keys once the optimizations ship in the pinned image.
